        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Warranty Conditions<br>
        Our products are guaranteed against operational faults occurring due to a manufacturing
        or material defect. The warranty only applies if the material is in its original state as
        delivered by the manufacturer.<br>
        Warranty period (of 2 years) or as mentioned in the quotation will be determined from the
        date of invoicing the light fixture to the first/original buyer and will be covered as follows:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company extends this express limited warranty only to the original buyer or to the

        fixture resulting from the use of auxiliary equipment not supplied by it.<br><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Obtaining Warranty Service:<br>
        If within the warranty period it appears that the installed light fixture does not meet the
        warranty conditions specified, the Buyer must notify the Company regarding the nature of the
        complaint at helpdesk@abbylighting.com of its warranty claim. The Company or its

        return the product at the Buyer&#39;s expense to Abby Lighting after receiving instructions as to
        when and where to ship the product. Failure to follow this procedure shall void this warranty.

        Buyer will be notified and adjustments will be made at that time. The Company reserves the
        right to examine all failed products and reserves the right to be the sole judge as to whether

        reserves the right to decide whether a product has been tampered with in which case the
        warranty becomes invalid.<br><br>

        as well as the transportation costs and risk of the required equipment and tools are borne by
        the buyer.<br><br>
